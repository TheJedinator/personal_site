Hello! I'm Jed Palmater, a software developer with 4 years of experience using modern Python, Java and Javascript frameworks to build web applications and REST APIs backed by various database management systems such as PostgresQL, MongoDB and OrientDB. I have had the pleasure of working in several different industries including, public sector, physical security, industrial manufacturing, Real Estate and currently FinTech. I'm passionate about how data is created, consumed and retained to and enjoy making data work for people. When I'm away from the keyboard I enjoy a good book, a strong cup of coffee, a day on the links or cycling through town.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jed-palmater) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/TheJedinator) for career and professional things
