title: AI Manifesto
---

Everything on this website is written by me using a keyboard (one that I probably like a lot). No content on this site is written by any AI tool or Large Language Model (LLM). I do use LLM's to review my blog posts, make recommendations for clarity, grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

I use AI extensively in my day to day coding and for that purpose I love it. As it has gained prominence in our culture and in my life the resounding desire I have is to hear the humanity, the original thought from people, and that is what I promise to deliver here.

I created the page by inspiration from [Cassidy Williams' own AI manifesto](https://cassidoo.co/ai/) and she was inspired by [a post from Damola Morenikeji](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto).

I appreciate your time reading my blog and promise that you will only see content hand written by yours truly.
