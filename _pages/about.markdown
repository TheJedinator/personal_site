Hi there! I'm Jed Palmater, and over the past five years, I've been building software with some amazing teams. My expertise centers around modern Python 🐍, Java, and JavaScript frameworks, where I’ve had the pleasure of building web applications and REST APIs, all backed by databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and OrientDB.

I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in a variety of industries, from the public sector to the fast-paced field of FinTech, including stops in physical security, industrial manufacturing and PropTech. My real passion lies in understanding and harnessing the power of data – how it's created, used, and stored – and making it truly beneficial for users.

When I step away from coding 💻, I love unwinding with a good book 📚, indulging in a strong cup of coffee ☕️, enjoying a day of golf ⛳️, or taking a leisurely bike ride 🚴🏽‍♂️ around town with my dog 🐶 Chewie and Fiancé 💍 Melissa.
