title: Website Journey

I think I'm probably an overly optimistic person, (at least the guy who wrote the post [A Personal Website](/2022-12-19-a-personal-site/) was). I think "I can get that done", and that done, and that done, and that done, only to find myself stressed out, and wishing I had less things on my plate. This is a self inflicted problem, no one forced me to make a website, or journal every day anything else I find fulfilling but also overwhelming. I need to take my own advice and just write, let the words flow and edit later (or never). 

Phew! Glad that's off my chest... Now you may or may not have noticed a new look around here... I finally got around to using an [new jekyll theme](https://beautifuljekyll.com/), and I think it turned out awesome! I also moved the about me to it's own page and created a favicon using ChatGPT4 and DALL-E! 

I'd say expect more content here in the future, but I'm not going to make any promises that will lead to more stress. I'll just say I'm going to try to write more, and if I don't, that's okay too.
