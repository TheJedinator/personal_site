title: I'm not Vibe Coding and neither are you
---

The term "vibe coding" started cropping up a few months ago, I thought it was a silly term for using "AI" to code. It's not, it's about taking an idea and materializing it into a functional application, prototype or proof of concept without ever actually writing a line of code. Andrej Karpathy is credited with inventing the term in a [Twitter post](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) in February and described it as "...fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists."

What that is to software is what building a house without a measuring tape is to carpentry. One can eyeball it and get pretty close if they're skilled, but it's never going to be square. The diffence with software is the nuance of code. Your vibe coded project may work 99 times out of 100 but that one time maybe it takes down your whole server. The vibe constructed house is going to be obviously off kilter from the instant you see it.

I think there are some great use cases for vibe coding, like building a prototype that can show actual behavioural intent rather than static designs, similiar to Figma's prototyping feature, but faster and better than doing it manually. What would take a designer days or weeks can now happen in minutes. This fast path to ideation will no doubt unlock exponentials in the product space but as the builders it's not what we want.

That's not coding, sure code is generated but as the "coder" in this context you have little to no understanding of what's happening, and you don't care. What you care about is that it does the thing. That's not what professional software developers do or want to do in production code. Sure there's a use case to get a product vision from 0 to 1 but that's such a rare event in the average developer's day to day that I don't think it deserves the attention it gets. The value for us as professional developers is in agentic coding.

WTF is Agentic coding?

You'd be forgiven if you thought "hey these look the same".... they do. The tools are exactly the same, it's the implementation that differs. The output matters as code not as "vibes" and the process to get there is a whole lot different.

💡 Like saying building a house and forgetting the wood or your measuring tape exist...
