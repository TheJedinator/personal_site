title: I'm not Vibe Coding and neither are you
---

The term "vibe coding" started cropping up a few months ago. I thought it was a silly term for using "AI" to code. It's not, it's about turning an into a functional application, prototype or proof of concept without ever actually writing a line of code. Andrej Karpathy coined the term in a [tweet](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) in February 2025 describing it as "...fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists."

Vibe coding is to software what building a house without a measuring tape is to carpentry. One can eyeball it and get pretty close, but it's never going to be square. Software's complexity lies in it's hidden nuance - the code. Your vibe coded project may work 99 times out of 100 but that one time it takes down your whole server. The vibe built house can't hide it's crooked framing, the vibe coded app hides it's flaws behind a shiny interface.

Don't get me wrong, I think there are some great use cases for vibe coding, like building a prototype that demonstrates real user behaviour rather than static designs. Similar to Figma's prototyping feature, only faster and far less manual. What would take a designer days or weeks can now happen in minutes. This fast path to ideation will no doubt unlock product innovation - but for us builders, it's not the goal.

The whole idea behind vibe coding is to forget about the code and focus on the result. That's not what professional software developers do. It's not what business wants from us either - lest we make our business into another headline like the [Tea app](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tea-app-hacked-13000-photos-leaked-4chan-call-action-rcna221139) breach that happened a few days ago. I've seen articles claiming the app was vibe coded but [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@jankammerath/tea-app-hack-disassembling-the-ridiculous-app-source-code-bc585e15bf4f) disassembling the app source code seems to counter that suggesting even AI wouldn't screw it up this badly.

> "This “hack” should’ve never happened. The “tea app” isn’t AI slop, it’s gross negligence from a, likely single, developer with very little experience that should not have been allowed to publish such an application without supervision. The app didn’t “get hacked”, it willingly published sensitive personally identifyable information to the world."

AI or incompetence aside the app "worked" as intended. But software isn't just about getting the job done; it involves nuance, craft, and consequences. The expectations I hold for both software I use and software I build is that it not only works, but does so reliably, safely and efficiently. To achieve that you have to understand the code, to understand the code you must read it - every line. Vibe coders are just not doing that and I'm not saying they should. I'm saying they should refrain from trying to build a business this way. So what is the alternative? As developers we need tools that amplify our agency, not replace it. Enter "Agentic coding".

## WTF is Agentic Coding?

Agentic coding combines two kinds of agency: the agent, your coding assistant doing work for you, and your own agency - the ability to make decisions and shape the result. I don't think we need to go deep on the latter since you've had it all along, what's really interesting is the coding agent.
