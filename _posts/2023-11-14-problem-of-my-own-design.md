title: A problem of my own design
---

I think I'm probably an overly optimistic person, (at least the guy who wrote the post [A Personal Website](/2022-12-19-a-personal-site/) was). I think of all these great things I can do, or want to do, put them on my list (at least I got that far) and never do them. Then I feel bad about not doing those things I want to do, then I feel bad about feeling bad. It's a vicious cycle. This is a problem of my own design, no one forced me to make a website, or journal every day, or anything else I find fulfilling but also overwhelming. I need to take my own advice and just write, let the words flow and edit later (or never). This doesn't only apply here but across all facets of my life, if I could just summon the energy and do the thing, I'd be a much happier person. 

Phew! Glad that's off my chest... Now you may or may not have noticed a new look around here... I finally got around to using a [new jekyll theme](https://beautifuljekyll.com/), and I think it turned out awesome! I also moved the about me to it's own page and created a favicon using ChatGPT4 and DALL-E! 

I'd say expect more content here in the future, but I'm not going to make any promises that will lead to more stress. I'll just say I'm going to try to write more, and if I don't, that's okay too.
